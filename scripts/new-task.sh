#!/usr/bin/env bash
# new-task.sh — Create an isolated git worktree for a single BDS task.
#
# Branches from origin/staging (staging-first flow). Enforces task/{scope}-{name} naming.
# Installs dependencies in the new worktree.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/new-task.sh {scope}-{name}
#   ./scripts/new-task.sh bds-button-variants
#   ./scripts/new-task.sh tokens-figma-pull
#
# Creates:
#   ../brikdesigns-worktrees/{scope}-{name}/   on branch  task/{scope}-{name}
#
# Requirements:
#   - Must be run from the repo root.
#   - Requires a clean working tree (no uncommitted changes).
#
# Why this exists: the shared main-repo `.git/HEAD` drifts silently when a
# second session checks out a task/* branch, and every edit afterward lands
# on the wrong branch. Worktrees are the fix — each session gets its own
# HEAD. See the Git Release Workflow Notion doc (Per-Repo Playbook table
# flagged BDS worktrees "Critical" after the 2026-04-19 incident).
