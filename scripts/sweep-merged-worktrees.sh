# sweep-merged-worktrees.sh — remove task worktrees whose work has landed.
#
# Why this exists: new-task.sh CREATES worktrees in ../brik-llm-worktrees/{slug}
# but nothing removes them once their PR merges, so they accumulate
# indefinitely (46 worktrees / ~930 MB found 2026-06-24). This is the missing
# teardown companion to new-task.sh. The primary stays on main (see
# worktree-guard.sh); task worktrees should disappear when their branch lands.
#
# Two teardown passes (brik-llm#1078):
#
# 1. TRACKED worktrees (still in `git worktree list`). REMOVABLE when clean AND
#    landed — PR MERGED, or tip is an ancestor of origin/main AND the branch has
#    something of its own committed (covers non-squash merges + direct-to-main).
#    Conservative:
#      - DIRTY worktrees are KEPT (uncommitted work — never auto-removed).
#      - OPEN-PR worktrees are KEPT (work in flight).
#      - NOT-STARTED worktrees (tip still == origin/main) are flagged for REVIEW,
#        never removed. `--is-ancestor` is reflexive, so without this a worktree
#        fresh out of new-task.sh read as "merged into main" and was swept
#        before its session's first commit (brik-llm#1616).
#      - DETACHED worktrees (no branch ref at all) are flagged for REVIEW, never
#        removed (brik-llm#2277). They used to be invisible here — see the block
#        in pass 1 for why the verdict is FLAG-only.
#      - Clean+unlanded+no-PR worktrees are flagged for REVIEW.
#
# 2. ORPHAN directories under the worktree root that git NO LONGER tracks
#    (absent from `git worktree list` — `git worktree prune` already stripped
#    the linkage once the branch was deleted, but the on-disk dir + its
#    node_modules were left behind: a 2026-06-19 sweep found 15 such dirs
#    totaling 17 GB). An orphan is REAPABLE only when its branch `task/<slug>`
#    has a MERGED PR AND is gone from both local and remote; otherwise it is
#    FLAG-ONLY (branch still exists or nothing proves it merged) and never
#    removed. A severed worktree can't be status-checked, so "merged PR + branch
#    gone from both sides" is the safe reapable signal — squash merges (which
#    leave the tip NOT an ancestor of main) are covered by the PR-MERGED check.
#
# 3. WORKTREE-LESS local `task/*` branches (brik-llm#2240). Passes 1 and 2 are
#    both keyed on a worktree — pass 1 iterates `git worktree list`, pass 2 walks
#    directories under the worktree root. Once BOTH are gone (which an earlier
#    run of this script does, in that order) the branch becomes invisible to the
#    sweeper and survives forever: 25 such branches had accumulated in brik-llm by
#    2026-08-16, while `--delete-branches` reported a clean sweep. DELETABLE only
#    when the remote branch is gone AND its PR is MERGED. An OPEN PR, or no PR at
#    all, is reported and KEPT — a branch with no PR is the one shape that could
#    still be unpushed work, and nothing here proves otherwise.
#
#    `git branch -d`/`--merged` cannot substitute for the PR check: squash-merge
#    leaves the tip NOT an ancestor of main, so `-d` refuses on exactly the
#    branches that have landed.
#
# 4. ORPHAN REMOTE REFS — `origin/task/*` with no local worktree (#1634, adopted
#    from brik-bds' reaper). Passes 1-3 are all local, so none of them can see a
#    ref pushed from another machine whose PR merged without auto-delete. OPT-IN
#    via --sweep-remote-refs: it is the only outward-facing mutation here, and
#    three of the four repos adopting this script have never done it.
#
# CANONICAL COPY — this file is byte-identical in brik-llm, brik-bds,
# brik-client-portal and brikdesigns (#1634). brik-llm holds the source of truth;
# scripts/audit/reaper-twin-drift.py fails CI when a copy diverges. Fix it HERE and
# re-sync; a local edit in a consumer repo will be reported as drift, not adopted.
# It needs no per-repo edits: the primary worktree, worktree root and repo slug are
# all derived at runtime from git and gh.
#
# Orphan accumulation across all roots is surfaced fleet-wide by
# claude-weekly-hygiene.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/sweep-merged-worktrees.sh                    # dry-run (default)
#   ./scripts/sweep-merged-worktrees.sh --apply            # remove landed worktrees + reap orphans
#   ./scripts/sweep-merged-worktrees.sh --reap             # alias for --apply
#   ./scripts/sweep-merged-worktrees.sh --delete-branches  # dry-run, incl. pass 3
#   ./scripts/sweep-merged-worktrees.sh --apply --delete-branches
#                                                          # also delete landed local branches,
#                                                          # worktree or not (pass 3)
#   ./scripts/sweep-merged-worktrees.sh --keep foo         # spare worktree/branch 'foo'
#   ./scripts/sweep-merged-worktrees.sh --apply --sweep-remote-refs
#                                                          # also delete landed origin/task/* refs
#   ./scripts/sweep-merged-worktrees.sh --json             # one JSON object on stdout, then exit
#                                                          # (always a dry-run read; never mutates)
#
# Env: BRIK_WORKTREE_ROOT overrides the swept root (default: <primary>-worktrees).
# Requires: gh (for PR state). Without gh, falls back to ancestor-of-main only
# for tracked worktrees; orphans need a MERGED PR so they stay flag-only. When gh
# is INSTALLED but its call fails, that same fallback engages and the run says so
# on stderr — see the warning below (#2277).
